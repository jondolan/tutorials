## [Motor Control: from PWM to PID](controls/PWMthroughPID/FromPWMtoPID.md)
The **objective** is to use an Arduino UNO to control a DC motor with PWM through a h-bridge, and then build off of that to utilize quadature encoder tick as feedback for a PID position control loop to drive the motor to a specific target.
